# jishmo
A simple tool to extract motion vectors from mpeg videos.

This is a tidy up of https://github.com/jishnujayakumar/MV-Tractus.git 

My intention is to process the motion vectors into an intruder score and dump them all in one file by timestamp, but first I'll CMake-ize it to avoid all that library source.

## Build instructions

mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
